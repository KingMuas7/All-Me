# Question 4

**Loading the data**

```{r}
my_data <- read_excel("C:/Users/Muassar/Documents/IHC 1997 to 2008.xlsx")
View(my_data)

*This table shows the monthly premiums and "standard" enrollments from 1997 to 2008 of the family premiums for three specific insurer/plans: 1) Horizon Blue Cross / Blue Shield of NJ, Plan B, $1,000 deductible; 2) Aetna Life Insurance Company, Plan D, $1,000 deductible; and 3) Celtic Insurance Company, Plan C, $2,500 deductible. Also, the data only focuses on the "Individual Health Coverage" (IHC) Programs.*



## Part 1

```{r}

colors <- c("Horizon Blue Cross / Blue Shield of NJ"="steelblue", "Aetna Life Insurance Company"="darkred", "Celtic Insurance Company"="lightgreen")

ggplot(my_data, aes(x=Years)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = my_data$`Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of NJ`, color = "Horizon Blue Cross / Blue Shield of NJ")) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = my_data$`Aetna Life Insurance Company`, color = "Aetna Life Insurance Company")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = my_data$`Celtic Insurance Company`, color = "Celtic Insurance Company")) + ggtitle("Insurance Premiums From 1997 to 2008") + labs(x = "Years", y = "Prices of Insurance Premiums", color = "Legend") + scale_color_manual(values = colors) 

```


*This graph shows the family premiums for three specific insurer/plans: 1) Horizon Blue Cross / Blue Shield of NJ, Plan B, $1,000 deductible; 2) Aetna Life Insurance Company, Plan D, $1,000 deductible; and 3) Celtic Insurance Company, Plan C, $2,500 deductible. Also, the data only focuses on the "Individual Health Coverage" (IHC) Programs.*



From the graph of the three insurance companies with their insurance premiums, we see that prices have been rising over the years. Starting off with Horizon Blue Cross / Blue SHield of NK, we see that prices of premiums had started off from a low amount but has rised over the years. For Aetna Life Insurance Company, prices of premiums started off low ass well but rised sharply in the coming few years and then stabilized at around 2001 up until 2005 but then rose sharply again. For Celtic Insurance Company, the prices of premiums rose similar to Aetna but in 2002, the prices rised very sharply up until 2003 from when the prices stabilized completely and have remained the same price all the way up to 2008.


## Part 2

```{r}

ggplot(data=my_data, aes(x=Years, y=my_data$`Total Number of Standard Enrollments Across All Plans At Year End`)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="steelblue")+
  geom_text(aes(label = my_data$`Total Number of Standard Enrollments Across All Plans At Year End`),vjust=-0.3, size=3.5)+
  theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Total Standard Enrollments Across All Insurance Plans (4Q) From 1997-2008", x = "Years", y = "Number of Enrollments")

```



## Part 3

These data are suggestive of the death spiral. We can see from the prices of the insurance premiums offered by the three insurers/plans that prices were generally rising as the years went by. From the Enrollment data across all plans, however, we see that the total "Standard" Enrollments fell each year from 1997-2008. Therefore, as prices were rising across plans, number of enrollment fell. This means that the insurers were losing their cheap, healthy consumers in order to be able to meet their Average Costs with the Demand to find an equilibrium. Otherwise, it would not make sense for insurers to increase prices. It seems that in order to maintain at least a "0" profit, there is a "Death Spiral" occuring in the insurance market over the years with prices increasing and enrollments decreasing over time.

# Question 5

**Loading the data**

```{r}
df <- read.delim("C:/Users/Muassar/Desktop/Academics/Emory Spring'22/ECON 372/hwk1_data-1.txt")

View(df)
```

## Part 1

The data includes myriad of Counties in different states and the number of enrollees from those respective Counties and States each year from 2008 to 2018. Firstly, omitting the "Not Available" (NA) values, then averaging the enrollments for each year from 2008 to 2018, we are able to produce a graph as such:

```{r}

df2 <- df[, c('year', 'enrolled')]

df2 <- na.omit(df2)

df_updated <- df2 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(enrolled), list(enrolled = mean))
  
colors <- ("enrolled"="darkred")

ggplot(df_updated, aes(x=year)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = enrolled, color = "enrolled"), size = 2) + ggtitle("Average Enrollment to Medicare Advantage Plans From 2008-2018") + labs(x = "Years", y = "Number of Enrollments", color = "Legend") + scale_color_manual(values = colors) 

```

From the graph, we can see that over time, the average number of enrollments to Medicare Advantage Plans increased over the years from 2008 to 2018.

## Part 2

Again, first we omit the "Not Available" (NA) values, then averaging the average ffs costs from each County and State for each year from 2008 to 2018, we are able to produce a graph as such:

```{r}
df3 <- df[, c('year', 'avg_ffscost')]

df3 <- na.omit(df3)

df_updated2 <- df3 %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(avg_ffscost), list(avg_ffscost = mean))

colors <- ("avg_ffscost"="pink")

ggplot(df_updated2, aes(x=year)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_ffscost, color = "avg_ffscost"), size = 2) + ggtitle("Average Medicare FFS Cost From 2008-2018") + labs(x = "Years", y = "Cost", color = "Legend") + scale_color_manual(values = colors) 
```

From the graph, we can see that the average FFS costs go up and down over the years while in the long term, the costs rise.

## Part 3

Looking at both the average enrollment and the average ffs costs during the period 2008-2018, we can see that both the enrollment and ffs costs have risen in the long term with enrollments having a steady increase over the period while the ffs costs have gone both up and down over the period. What can be assumed is that adverse selection can explain these trends. The average FFS costs are that of traditional Medicare and the Enrollments show the number of Enrollments for MEdicare Advantage. Now, as the prices of traditional Medicare increases, cheaper/healthier people leave the market and move on to Medicare Advantage and enroll in Medicare Advantage plans. Afterwards, with the healthier people leaving the traditional Medicare market, in an attempt to make at least "0" profit, the prices go up which ends up with even more people leaving the traditional Medicare market and enrolling in the Medicare Advantage plans. Therefore, through adverse selection, we can explain why the Average FFS Costs for traditional Medicare rise over time and the number of Enrollments rise over time for Medicare Advantage.

## Part 4

The three strategies used to minimize the effects of selection in the Medicare Advantage market are:

**1)** Using inpatient diagnoses to adjust payment; outpatient diagnostic information was considered unreliable.
**2)** Adoption of a new risk adjustment system that accounted for both inpatient and outpatient diagnostic information, the CMS-HCC system.
**3)** Imposing a partial enrollment lock-in which restricted when beneficiaries could switch from MA to TM

## Part 5

I believe the adoption of the CMS-HCC system will help alleviate Health Insurance Exchanges. By analyzing and calculating the individual scores of patients using demographics and risk adjustment factors, the annual expenditure would generally fall. Therefore there would not be miss-allocation or overspending in the Medicare Advantage Plans for healthier people which would eventually cause a stop in the Health Insurance Exchanges. With the use of Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC), MA programs are able to translate their per-member-per-month (PMPM) payments very accurately and thus MA programs do not account for unexplainable financial losses. With the correct estimation of the severity of illness in the MA programs, the CMS-HCC system will be able to allocate funds accordingly with no excess spending on the MA plans. This would lead to a lower shift in the health insurance exchanges. It is imperative, however, that the HCCs are accurate.There are challenges to this especially int he outpatient setting which struggles with inadequate coding administrative infrastructure.
